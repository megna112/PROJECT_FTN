                The idea took root in Mangalore, where we started with 5 a
                volunteer to collect the surplus food and deliver to the
                homeless through Public Transportation System from September
                1st, 2018. We took an oath on that day to stop food waste and
                satisfy the hunger of many, in a quest to make the “World Hunger
                Free.”

                Surplus food is picked up from the food donor and packed in
                clean and covered containers. Surplus food is stored and
                transported in appropriate hygienic condition at appropriate
                optimum temperature suitable for perishable and non-perishable
                food separately. Transporting vehicle is cleaned on a regular
                basis and not for purposes other than delivering food. Surplus
                food is distributed or served to the needy before the expiry of
                surplus food. Spoiled food is avoided at any case and preferable
                diverted to alternative solutions such as composting, bio-gas
                plants ensuring that it also doesn’t reaches dustbin or
                landfills. Food is always stored off the floor and away from
                walls and non-food items. Storage area, including the floor,
                pallets and shelves are cleaned regularly. Doors, windows and
                roofs of storage area are well sealed to prevent pest entry and
                a pest control program is organized at regular intervals. Our
                staffs and volunteers are oriented with personal hygiene and
                sanitation practices for maintaining hygiene standards in food
                handling. We are maintaining a standard documentation process in
                which we record details of surplus food viz. details of donor,
                hunger spots, donation date, food item, food quantity, date of
                distribution.
